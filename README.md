Doorkee React/Redux Node/Express full stack code test

## Instructions:

### backend:
 
1. Extend the existing Node backend to store (and update every 2 seconds) the location of the ISS (from [this api](http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json)) in the Mongo database.
2. Create a route for retrieving the location of the ISS to be used by the frontend

### frontend:

1. Use a map library of your choice ([Google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/), etc) to display the location of the ISS from the backend. It should automatically update every 5 seconds.
2. Create a Header with at least three dead links (About, Contact, Whatever, etc)
    - On desktop: 
      * Logo on the left side
      * links centered and spaced evenly horizontally
    - On Mobile:
      * Logo on the left side
      * Hamburger button on the right side that opens a drawer with the links spaced evenly vertically
